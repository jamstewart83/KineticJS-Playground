KinectJS-Playground
===================

Playing about with KinectJS for canvas drawing.  If warranted I will document further, but this will mostly contain my findings as I develop my knowledge of the framework.

=========Why KinectJS?=============
I looked at 3 other options open to me:
	
	1. Raphael
	My issue with Raphael wasn't that it was a poor framework I just felt it was overly complicated to do certain things but that's just my opinion.  I also felt the documentation lacked code examples for each property.
	2. jCanvas
	I only looked at this briefly and because I'm writing this in hindsight I can't remember why I decided it wasn't for me.
	3. Native Canvas
	While drawing something in canvas natively is an easy task mouse interaction is a different beast.  You need to bind your events to the canvas element and I dentify elements based on their positioning which would be an interesting project in the future but not something I wanted to pursue at this time.

So after trying these others out I decided to go with KinectJS.  It had most of the base functionality I wanted as well as excellent documentation and examples.
